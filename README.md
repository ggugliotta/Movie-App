- Flickette is a movie application built for movie fans who enjoy learning information about a variety of films. Users are able to access this application whenever they want to read and save information about their favorite movies. This app is [hosted online](flickette.netlify.app) and can be viewed on any device at any time anywhere for complete user experience. This [client-side project](github.com/ggugliotta/myFlix-client-side) supports the [server-side portion of this application](github.com/ggugliotta/movie-app) and was created to facilitate user requests and render responses from the server-side via multiple interface views. This app was built in ES2015+ with the full MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React library, Node.js), and bootstrap UI library. A full list of project dependencies are outlined below. 

- Build Tool: To get this project running, I used @parcel/transformer-sass version 2.9.3, parcel version 2.9.3, and process 0.11.10. 

- Project dependencies include: @reduxjs/toolkit version 1.9.7, bootstrap version 5.3.2       js-tokens version 4.0.0,loose-envify version 1.4.0, prop-types version 15.8.1, react 18.2.0, 
react-bootstrap version 2.9.0, react-dom version 18.2.0, react-redux 8.1.3, react-router 6.16.0, react-router-dom version 6.16.0, and scheduler version 0.16.0.
